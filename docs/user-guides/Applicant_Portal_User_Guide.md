Applies to version: `v0.14.1`

Last verified: 2026-07-05

Audience: applicants and accepted program participants.

Required access: Keycloak applicant account with the `APPLICANT` role. Dashboard and mission pages require
an accepted application for the tenant program.

## Purpose

The Applicant Portal is the participant-facing side of TalentOS. Applicants use it to discover a tenant
program, create an account, submit an application, track application status, and, after acceptance, access
their learning dashboard and missions.

## Account Signup and Login

TalentOS uses Keycloak for identity and access management.

1. Open the Applicant Portal.
2. Select the login action.
3. To create a new applicant account, use the Keycloak registration flow exposed from the portal.
4. Sign in with email and password.
5. If prompted, complete the required password change.
6. If prompted, configure authenticator-app 2FA.

Password policy, password reset, first-login password change, and 2FA setup are owned by Keycloak.

## Apply to a Program

1. Open `http://demo.lvh.me:3100/apply`.
2. Sign in if redirected to login.
3. Select a published program.
4. Enter the motivation/application answer.
5. Upload a CV if requested by the form.
6. Add GitHub and LinkedIn profile URLs when available.
7. Submit the application.

After submission, TalentOS records the application as `SUBMITTED`. Duplicate active applications for the
same program are blocked.

## View Application Status

1. Open `http://demo.lvh.me:3100/application`.
2. Review the current application status.
3. If the status changes after admin review, the page reflects the updated decision.

Common statuses are:

- `SUBMITTED`
- `UNDER_REVIEW`
- `ACCEPTED`
- `REJECTED`
- `WAITLISTED`

## Accepted Applicant Dashboard

Accepted applicants can open `http://demo.lvh.me:3100/dashboard`.

The dashboard contains:

- Dashboard overview
- My Program
- Tasks
- Missions
- Resources
- Calendar
- Notifications
- Profile

Applicants without an accepted application are redirected back to their application/status flow.

## Missions

Missions are the learning-by-building assignments in TalentOS. In `v0.14.0`, accepted applicants can view
published missions for their accepted program.

To view missions:

1. Sign in as an accepted applicant.
2. Open the dashboard.
3. Select **Missions** in the sidebar.
4. Open a mission to review the objective, acceptance criteria, deliverables, evaluation criteria, and
   competency tags.

The seeded Week 1 mission is **Build a Public Product Landing Page**.

Mission submission, engineering journal entries, and portfolio publishing are future workflows.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cannot sign in | Wrong tenant URL, wrong credentials, or stale Keycloak session | Use the correct tenant URL and sign out/in again. |
| Asked to change password | First-login security requirement | Complete the Keycloak password update. |
| Asked to configure 2FA | First-login security requirement | Use an authenticator app and complete setup. |
| Dashboard is not visible | Application is not accepted | Check application status first. |
| No missions are visible | No published missions for accepted program | Contact the program administrator. |
| Apply form does not show a program | No published program exists for the tenant | Contact the program administrator. |
